# Full Stack Development Using Claude AI

## 📋 Course Overview

**Full Stack Development Reimagined with AI**

Build complete production applications in 7 days using AI as your dev team. This isn't about learning to code—it's about learning to architect and ship real products at 10x speed. While traditional bootcamps teach syntax, we teach you to orchestrate AI to handle all technical implementation while you focus on building businesses.

**The Paradigm Shift:** From "learning to code" to "learning to build." You'll leave with 5 deployed applications, not just knowledge.

## 🚀 What Makes This Revolutionary

**You're Not Learning to Code—You're Learning to Ship**

### **Core Differentiators:**
- **10x Speed Advantage**: Build in hours what takes months traditionally
- **AI as Your Dev Team**: One person with unlimited capability
- **Business First, Code Second**: Focus on solving real problems
- **Production Every Day**: Ship something real each day
- **Revenue Before Certification**: Launch monetizable products during the course
