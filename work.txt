You are a senior full-stack engineer, product designer, and brand copywriter in one.

Your job: 
Help me design and build a complete, production-ready marketing + content site for my brand:

- Brand name: MindIsGear
- Short handle: MIG
- Domain: mindisgear.com
- Core idea: "Mind is gear" → we turn ideas and knowledge into real systems, tools, and automations.

We’ll build this as a modern, clean, fast site with:
- Product pages for MIG tools
- A blog/playbook about automation & AI
- An Academy / resources area

==================================================
1. PROJECT CONTEXT
==================================================

Brand meaning:
- "Mind" = strategy, thinking, knowledge.
- "Gear" = tools, systems, automation, execution.
- MindIsGear = “we take what’s in your mind and turn it into working systems.”

What MindIsGear (MIG) does:
- AI & automation studio specializing in:
  - workflow automation (n8n/Make/Zapier etc.)
  - data scraping & data pipelines
  - AI agents / chatbots (support, internal tools)
  - micro-SaaS for real businesses (wholesalers, tours, small shops, etc.)

Target audience:
- Small/medium businesses, agencies, and founders who:
  - are busy and overwhelmed with manual work
  - want to automate repetitive tasks and data work
  - want simple tools, not huge enterprise systems
- Slightly technical audience as well (developers/founders) who will read blog/academy content.

Tone of voice:
- Clear, simple, confident.
- No corporate fluff. Friendly but serious.
- Less “buzzword AI”, more “we build working systems.”

Some tagline ideas (you can choose the best and refine it):
- “Turn your mind into gear.”
- “Your ideas. Our systems.”
- “From brainwave to bot.”
Pick one primary tagline and a couple alternates for different sections.

==================================================
2. TECH & ARCHITECTURE CHOICES
==================================================

Use this stack:

- Framework: Next.js (latest stable, App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Content:
  - Blog posts in MDX or Markdown
  - Academy lessons/resources in Markdown / MDX or simple JSON/TS data
- Build: Static site or hybrid (static pages + dynamic blog/MDX)
- Deployment: Assume Vercel or any Node-capable platform. Provide generic instructions.

Overall goals:
- Clean, modern, responsive design.
- Good Lighthouse scores for performance & SEO.
- Simple enough that a solo dev (me) can extend it later.

==================================================
3. SITEMAP & PAGES
==================================================

Design and implement the site around this core sitemap:

1. Home:          `/`
2. Products:      `/products`
   - MIG Flow:    `/products/mig-flow`
   - MIG Scout:   `/products/mig-scout`
   - MIG AI Desk: `/products/mig-ai-desk`
   - MIG Learn (Academy): `/products/mig-learn`
3. Academy:       `/academy`
   - Lesson details: `/academy/[slug]`
4. Blog:          `/blog`
   - Post details:   `/blog/[slug]`
5. Resources:     `/resources`
6. About:         `/about`
7. Contact:       `/contact`

You may adjust URLs slightly if needed for a clean Next.js App Router structure, but keep the idea.

Page requirements (copy + structure):

  - Values: transparency, simplicity, shipping real things.

--------------------------------------
CONTACT `/contact`
--------------------------------------
- Simple contact form UI (no backend, just front-end for now).
- Show email placeholder.
- Show optional WhatsApp/Telegram placeholder.

==================================================
5. IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
==================================================

I want you to work in clear PHASES and talk to me like a collaborator.

PHASE 1: HIGH-LEVEL PLAN
- Summarize:
  - Final sitemap.
  - Chosen stack and reasons (short).
  - Content model:
    - where blog posts live
    - where academy lessons live
    - where resources data lives
- Show a proposed folder structure (tree) for the Next.js app:
  - `app/` routes
  - `components/`
  - `content/` or `data/` for blog/academy/resources
  - `lib/` for utilities
- Ask me if I want to adjust anything before code. (If I don’t respond, assume “go ahead”.)

PHASE 2: PROJECT SCAFFOLDING
- Provide:
  - `package.json` core dependencies.
  - Tailwind setup (tailwind.config, postcss config) with minimal needed config.
  - `next.config` (if you need anything special).
  - Base layout in `app/layout.tsx` including:
    - global `<html>` & `<body>`
    - base font
    - `<Navbar />` and `<Footer />` usage.
  - `app/page.tsx` initial Home page skeleton reflecting sections.

PHASE 3: CORE COMPONENTS
- Implement reusable components:
  - Navbar
  - Footer
  - Hero
  - Section wrapper
  - Product cards
  - Blog card
  - Lesson/resource cards
  - Callout boxes

Use TypeScript types for props where helpful.

PHASE 4: CONTENT & ROUTES
- Implement routes and pages for:
  - /products and each product detail.
  - /academy and /academy/[slug].
  - /blog and /blog/[slug].
  - /resources.
  - /about.
  - /contact (form UI only).

- For content:
  - Create a small content system:
    - Option A: MDX files loaded via next-mdx.
    - Option B: Static TS/JSON arrays exported from `data/` folder.
  - You can choose whichever is simplest and clearly explain your choice.

- Write REALISTIC sample content (not lorem ipsum), based on the brand context above, especially for:
  - 3 blog posts.
  - 4–6 academy lessons (titles + full article content for at least 2–3).
  - 4–6 resources (with short descriptions).
  - All main product pages.

PHASE 5: SEO, META, & DX
- Show how to set:
  - Metadata (title, description) per page or via Next.js metadata API.
  - Open Graph tags (basic).
- Add a simple `README.md` explaining:
  - How to install dependencies.
  - Commands to run dev server, build, and export/deploy.
- Suggest improvements for:
  - Accessibility (headings, alt text).
  - Performance (image usage, loading).

PHASE 6: FINAL REVIEW
- Summarize:
  - File structure.
  - How to extend the blog and academy with more content.
  - Suggestions for future features (contact form backend, newsletter signup, login for premium academy content, etc.).

==================================================
6. OUTPUT STYLE & CONSTRAINTS
==================================================

General rules for your responses:
- Be explicit and organized.
- Use clear headings and code blocks.
- When you show a directory tree, use a nice tree-style format.
- When showing code, include the filename above each snippet like:
  - `// app/page.tsx`
- Don’t flood with completely repetitive boilerplate; for repeated patterns, you may say “repeat the same pattern as in X, with changed Y and Z fields” where appropriate, but PLEASE still fully implement at least one example of each type:
  - one blog post file
  - one academy lesson file
  - one resource file (if separate)
  - one product page template in full.
